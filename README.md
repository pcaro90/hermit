## Hermit

Hermit is a monospace font designed to be clear, pragmatic and very readable.
Its creation has been focused on programming. Every glyph was carefully planned
and calculated, according to defined principles and rules. For this reason,
Hermit is coherent and regular.


## Features

*   Monospace. Clear and readable. Nice for coding.
*   Medium, Light and Bold versions.
*   Clear, at least, on sizes 8 and bigger.
*   Symbols stand out from common text. Dots and commas are easily seen, and
    operators are clear even when not surrounded by spaces.
*   Similar characters have been done very distinguishable.
*   Complete Latin-0 character set ([ISO
    8859-15](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-15)).
*   Integrated [Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline) symbols.
*   [OFL 1.1 License][ofl].

## Cost

Hermit is free, as in both "free beer" and "freedom". However, if and only if
you like my work and you think I deserve it, I accept
[donations](https://pcaro.es/donations). But, if you don't want or you can't
donate, I will think you are awesome anyway.


## Downloads

You can download the Hermit font on [my website][site].

Hermit is also available in
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/otf-hermit/) and

## Improvements, issues, suggestions

If you have a good idea for an improvement in Hermit, or you have found an
issue, or you have a great suggestion for a future version, you can send me an
[email][email]. If you are trying to explain me something you don't like, you
should attach a screnshot.

I also like emails that just say you like Hermit!


## To Do in a future version

Hermit is not perfect. It was done under certain circumstances, trying to fill
some needs. However, this could not be enough to fill somebody else's needs.
This is the list of those unfilled needs. If you want to know if a new version
is been prepared, you can visit [my site][site], or you
can follow me on [Twitter][twitter].

*   Add Cyrillic characters.
*   Add Greek characters.
*   Add more Unicode characters.
